According to Wayne Hale, a flight director from Johnson Space Center, the Space
Shuttle orbiter represents a “huge technological leap from expendable rockets
and capsules to a reusable, winged, hypersonic, cargo-carrying spacecraft.”
Although her base structure followed a conventional aircraft design, she used
advanced materials that both minimized her weight for cargo-carrying purposes
and featured low thermal expansion ratios, which provided a stable base for her
Thermal Protection System (TPS) materials. Other notable engineering
achievements of the orbiter included the first reusable orbital propulsion
system, and the first two-fault-tolerant Integrated Avionics System. Under
Criterion A, Discovery is significant as the oldest of the three extant orbiter
vehicles constructed for the Space Shuttle Program (SSP), the longest running
American space program to date; she was the third of five orbiters built by
NASA.
