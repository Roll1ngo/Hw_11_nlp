According to Wayne Hale, a flight director from Johnson Space Center, the Space
Shuttle orbiter represents a “huge technological leap from expendable rockets
and capsules to a reusable, winged, hypersonic, cargo-carrying spacecraft.”
Although her base structure followed a conventional aircraft design, she used
advanced materials that both minimized her weight for cargo-carrying purposes
and featured low thermal expansion ratios, which provided a stable base for her
Thermal Protection System (TPS) materials. Including her maiden voyage (launched
August 30, 1984), Discovery flew to space thirty-nine times, more than any of
the other four orbiters; she was also the first orbiter to fly twenty missions.
Other notable engineering achievements of the orbiter included the first
reusable orbital propulsion system, and the first two-fault-tolerant Integrated
Avionics System.
